# Predicting Airbnb Prices in New York (Kaggle Competition)
Final Kaggle Ranking: #2 on the Private Leaderboard

# Summary
As I got started on my first Kaggle Competition, the problem I set out to solve was how to predict the prices of Airbnb rentals in New York; what factors influence the rental price of an Airbnb? As an active Airbnb user, I knew I always looked at specific attributes when choosing a rental: number of guests, location, amenities, and so on. Therefore, I was excited to dive deeper and analyze which of these factors actually have an impact on how Airbnb listings are priced.

The goal of the competition was to build a predictive model that would generate the most accurate price predictions by using a data set with over 35,000 listings and 95 variables.
