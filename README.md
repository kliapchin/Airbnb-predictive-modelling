# Predicting Airbnb Prices in New York (Kaggle Competition)
As I got started on my first Kaggle Competition, the problem I set out to solve was how to predict the prices of Airbnb rentals in New York; what factors influence the rental price of an Airbnb? As an active Airbnb user, I knew I always looked at specific attributes when choosing a rental: number of guests the place can accommodate, the location, what amenities are available, and so on. Therefore, I was excited to dive deep into Airbnb’s data and analyze which of these factors actually impact the way Airbnb listings are priced.

The goal of the competition was to build a predictive model that would generate the most accurate price predictions for an Airbnb rental by using a data set with over 35,000 listings and 95 variables.

# Summary
So which exact attributes of an Airbnb rental in New York can help us accurately predict its price? 

I tackled this project by looking at it from both the tenant's and the host's perspectives - trying to understand the things that matter to each party and what impact those might have on the listing’s price.

As I went through extensive exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and experimentation with different types of models, the list of significant attributes got smaller and smaller. A lot of the findings reaffirmed my initial hunch on the important attributes: number of guests the rental accommodates, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, presence of specific amenities (e.g. an elevator or a gym), the neighborhood, etc. There were, however, additional key attributes that I found, which I did not initially expect to be as meaningful in predicting a listing's price. These included the total number of listings an Airbnb host held, the minimum number of nights required for a booking, and the number of days since the first or the last reviews for the listing were posted. 

# Project Takeaways
This was my first supervised learning project and, overall, I was rather satisfied with the results. Although at times I felt as though I was completely lost, I learned that the imposter syndrome is more common that one might think, and it is important to not let that bring you down.

This experience has made me more confident in my modeling skills (as well as my overall R skills) and in my understanding of the concepts and methods used in supervised learning. I am excited to continue growing in this area and to explore new ways of improving my data analysis and modeling skills, as well as my ability to effectively translate findings into actionable insights.
